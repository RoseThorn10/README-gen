# README Generator

## Description
This application uses Node JS and a 3rd party module to create a professional README file completely from command line inputs.

## Usage
Users will be prompted in the terminal to input information in order to automatically generate a README file. They will answer questions including the title of their project, whether there is a license, instructions for use, and other questions. Users will also have an opportunity to enter their GitHub URL as well as an email address where people can contact them with questions or comments.
